> 
> I'll select Ethereum as the source chain, Polygon as the destination, and enter 100 USDC. 
> 
> Behind the scenes, Avail Nexus simulates the bridge transaction, calculates optimal routing, and estimates fees - all before execution.
> 
> The same seamless experience works for transfers and swaps across any supported chain."

**On Screen:**

## üé¨ SCENE 7: DEMO - AI AGENT CONTROLS (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual:** Agent Control Panel with Status/Configuration/Policies tabs

**Script:**
> "Now for the AI magic. The Agent Control Panel shows three automation levels:
> 
> **Manual Mode** - You approve every action.
> **Semi-Auto** - Agent suggests, you approve high-value transactions.
> **Full-Auto** - Complete autonomy within your defined limits.
> 
> The Configuration tab lets you set thresholds. For example: only rebalance when gas is below 30 gwei, or limit transactions to $1,000.
> 
> The Policies tab shows Lit Protocol PKP rules. These are programmable signing conditions - the agent can ONLY execute transactions that match your security policies."

**On Screen:**
- Click through Status ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Policies tabs
- Highlight automation mode selector
- Show threshold sliders (Gas: 30 gwei, Max Amount: $1000)

> "Here's how it works under the hood:
> 
> **Step 1:** Envio HyperSync monitors your portfolio and detects opportunities - like low gas prices or high-yield pools.
> 
> **Step 2:** The AI decision engine analyzes the data and generates optimization recommendations.
> 
> **Step 3:** Lit Protocol PKP validates the action against your security policies.
> 
> **Step 4:** If approved, Avail Nexus SDK executes the cross-chain operation.
> 
> All of this happens automatically, 24/7."
